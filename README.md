# LaunchLinux
### FMMT666's launchpad.py at work. Control linux volume and more.

#Instalation
* Be sure you use python2 (for now)
* install https://github.com/FMMT666/launchpad.py
* install https://github.com/ziberna/i3-py
* install pygame, alsaaudio, and anyother depenancies you don't have.
* You're on github, and it's in python. If you're here I belive in you
* You can do this.


Soon you will be able to control:

[X] is done-ish, [O] is in progress, [P] is planned
* [X]Volume Level (Alsa)
* [X]i3 workspaces
* [O]program launching
* [P]clipboard contents
* [P]and more (if I think of anything?)

all directly from your Novation LaunchPad Mk2
(others may come later, or might even work already?)

Thanks to *FMMT666* for the LaunchPad.py library that makes it all possible
and to Ziberna for i3-python
